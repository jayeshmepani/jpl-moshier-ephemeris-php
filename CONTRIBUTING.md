## Development Setup

### Requirements

* PHP 8.3 or higher with FFI extension enabled
* Composer
* Git
* C compiler (gcc) for building `libjme.so` if needed

### Installation

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jpl-moshier-ephemeris-php.git
cd jpl-moshier-ephemeris-php

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Run tests
composer test

# Run code style checks
composer lint
```

### FFI Configuration

Ensure FFI is enabled in your `php.ini`:

```ini
ffi.enable=preload
# or
ffi.enable=true
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run tests with coverage
composer test:coverage

# Run specific test file
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/SpecificTest.php
```

### Code Style

We use [Laravel Pint](https://github.com/laravel/pint) for code formatting:

```bash
# Fix code style issues
composer lint

# Check code style without fixing
composer lint:check
```

### Static Analysis

We use [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) for static analysis:

```bash
# Run PHPStan
composer phpstan
```

## Coding Standards

* Follow [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standards
* Use meaningful variable and method names
* Add PHPDoc comments for public methods
* Keep methods small and focused
* Write tests for new features
* Maintain compatibility with the project-owned JME native contract

## Important Notes

* Do NOT remove or rename constants
* DO maintain exact C data types (double, int32, etc.)
* DO test against the JME native library behavior

### Native Library Licensing
